# Total-Fertility-Rate-Analysis
The project contains an in-depth analysis of the total fertility rate of all the countries from 2000 to 2020. 

First, an overall decreasing trend has been observed on an average for all the countries.
Next, an overall decreasing trend has also been observed for India. 
A comparative study was done between developed countries (such as USA, Canada, Italy, France, Germany, Japan and UK) and underdeveloped countries (such as Niger, Burundi, Central African Republic, Chad, Mali, Mozambique and South Sudan). Both the groups showed a decreasing trend but for the developed countries total fertility rate values lied between 2.2 and 1.2, whereas for the underdeveloped countries, total fertility rate values lied between 8 and 4.5. 
A world map was plotted  with total fertility rate values of 2020.
